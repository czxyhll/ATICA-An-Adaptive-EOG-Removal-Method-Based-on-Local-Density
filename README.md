ATTENTION!!! 
https://github.com/Gaitxh/ATICA-An-Adaptive-EOG-Removal-Method-Based-on-Local-Density-
is the new version where I rearranged the code， we suggested that you adopted the new one for testing and application.

In addition, we suggested that the novel method that we proposed for ocular artifacts removal, please reffered to https://github.com/Gaitxh/FCCJIA-An-adaptive-joint-CCA-ICA-method-for-ocular-artifact-removal, and paper "Gao X, Zhang S, Liu K, et al. An Adaptive Joint CCA-ICA Method for Ocular Artifact Removal and its Application to Emotion Classification[J]. Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 2023: 109841.", which method denoted the faster computation and more efficient computation!!!!!!
